# FlexionCodeReview

#### Prioritized list of development tasks I would like to do next to improve my solution to the code challenge

1. Improve usability of the UI to allow for students and teach to provide comments to each other
2. Improve performance of web form validation and back-end evaluation of answers submitted.
3. Add more security to the application to ensure students cannot login as teachers, etc.
4. Containerize the application to allow for docker installation
5. Store student and teacher data in a nosql db
